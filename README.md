# phone-fw
The firmware portion of a [phone I built](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/phone). You might also want to see [the hardware](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/phone-hw).

Unfortunately, while the hardware is somewhat capable, the firmware is rather limited in what it currently can do.

## Things that would be nice to have
* Sleep/wake instead of just always being on all the time
* Some sort of text input method
* Bluetooth device setup (specifically for headsets so that audio input/output can happen)
* Volume up/down (needs audio first)
* Ability to send SMS
* Making calls
* Receiving calls
* Connecting to WiFi
* Actually do something with the GPRS data connection (a browser might be too much, but weather? news?)
* Do more with the GPS data than set the time (would a map app be too much?)
